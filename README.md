# Tboi-Ascii
  The binding of isaac fan-made remake made with ascii graphics on python.

#How to run it:
  First, download all the files from the button in the right side of the screen that says Master zip and extract it where you want to have the game. 
  
  You'll need to have python3.4.x installed. If you don't have it, you can install it from https://www.python.org/downloads/
Then;
On windows: Double click init64.exe or init32.exe depending on the architecture of your system (though init32 should work on both)
  	
On mac/linux: Open a terminal instance and type: "./init.sh"(Without the "s) (If this doesn't work you can manually type "python ./src/main.py")  
  
#Create your own rooms:
  Go to rooms folder. starting.room is the one you get when you start a run, the others are randomly chosen. 
  You don't need any kind of special software to edit them, you can use notepad if you want :)
=======
  
  On linux/osx open terminal in the /src folder (open terminal then type: cd /path/to/Tboi-Ascii/src/ + enter) and then type: python main.py
  
  On windows open cmd and to the same OR alternatively I think you can double-click python files to execute them but I'm not sure (I'm not a windows user), if you can, the double-click main.py on the /src folder

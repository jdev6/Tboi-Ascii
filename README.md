# Tboi-Ascii
  The binding of isaac fan-made remake made with ascii graphics on python.

#How to run it:
  First, download all the files from the button in the right side of the screen that says Master zip and extract it where you want to have the game. 
  
  You'll need to have python3.4.x installed. If you don't have it, you can install it from https://www.python.org/downloads/
  
  Then: 

  	On windows: Double click init.exe or init.bat. They are both the same
	On mac/linux: Open a terminal instance and type: "./init.sh" (If this doesn't work you can manually type "python ./src/main.py")  

#Create your own rooms:
  Go to rooms folder. starting.room is the one you get when you start a run, the others are randomly chosen. 
  You don't need any kind of speceial software to edit them, you can use notepad if you want :)
